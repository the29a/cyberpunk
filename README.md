### Art styles
#### Glitch Art
Glitch art is the practice of using digital or analog errors for aesthetic purposes by either corrupting digital data or physically manipulating electronic devices.
- [Wikipedia: Glitch art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_art)

#### New Aesthetic 
The New Aesthetic is a term coined by James Bridle used to refer to the increasing appearance of digital technology and the Internet in the physical world, and the blending of virtual and physical. The phenomenon has been around for a long time but James Bridle articulated the notion through a series of talks and observations.
- [Wikipedia: New Aesthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Aesthetic)

#### Net Art
Internet art (also known as net art) is a form of new media art distributed via the Internet. This form of art circumvents the traditional dominance of the physical gallery and museum system. In many cases, the viewer is drawn into some kind of interaction with the work of art. Artists working in this manner are sometimes referred to as net artists. 
- [Wikipedia: Internet art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_art)

#### Street Art 
Street art is visual art created in public locations for public visibility. It has been associated with the terms "independent art," "post-graffiti", "neo-graffiti" and guerrilla art. Street art has evolved from the early forms of defiant graffiti into a more commercial form of art, as one of the main differences now lies with the messaging. 
- [Wikipedia: Street art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_art)

#### Robotic Artwork
Robotic art is any artwork that employs some form of robotic or automated technology. There are many branches of robotic art, one of which is robotic installation art, a type of installation art that is programmed to respond to viewer interactions, by means of computers, sensors and actuators. 
- [Wikipedia: Robotic Artwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_art)
